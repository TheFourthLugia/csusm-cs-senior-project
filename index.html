                                <p>This page contains a collection of previous Capstone and course projects for Computer Science, Computer Information Systems, and Software Engineering courses in CSUSM. They are mainly set up by seniors majoring in any of the three subjects. These projects can be found in the Senior Projects page.</p>
                                
                                <h3>What is a Capstone Project?</h3>
                                <p>A capstone project is a semester-long or year-long course that involves students working in groups to develop and deliver a semester-long project for a CSUSM sponsor from a third-party company or individual. The project can cover a wide range of topics, from software development to machine learning to cybersecurity. Throughout the project, students apply the skills and knowledge they have gained in their computer science coursework to real-world problems and challenges.</p>

                                <p>This often involves working closely with the sponsor to understand their needs and requirements, developing a plan and timeline for the project, and using various programming tools and technologies to build and test the solution. At the end of the semester, the students present their project to the sponsor and showcase their work to faculty and peers.</p>

                                <p>This experience provides students with valuable hands-on learning and professional development opportunities, as well as the chance to make meaningful contributions to real-world projects.</p>

                                <h3>Computer Science (CS)</h3>

                                <p>Computer Science is basically the study of problem-solving on computers. We utilize the power of computers in the problem-solving process while dealing with the constraints of computers. We offer to the undergraduate and graduate student a rich mix of modern computer science courses. Common to these offerings are the power, beauty, and utility of computational thought.</p>

                                <p>Applications of Computer Science knowledge include almost every field from business to education, from humanities to social sciences, or from natural sciences to engineering. Therefore, the study of Computer Science contains many fields such as computer architecture, programming languages, computer networking, database systems, information management, artificial intelligence and numerical analysis.</p>

                                <h3>Computer Information Systems (CIS)</h3>

                                <p>The Computer Information Systems program at CSUSM combines computing essentials with coursework in other areas including business, economics, and social science. Both theoretical foundations and practical applications are emphasized in the CIS program to equip our students with programming, system design, data processing and analysis capabilities to address emerging challenges in the Information Age. Our CIS program focuses on the interplay of human, information, and computing technologies in various domains, preparing students for careers in information management, data engineering, information systems analysis, and ERP software solutions, as well as for entrance into graduate and professional schools.</p>

                                <p><i><b>NOTE:</b> Students majoring in Computer Information Systems cannot minor in Computer Science.</i></p>
